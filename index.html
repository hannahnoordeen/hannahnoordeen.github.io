            <p id = "interests">My main interests within Computer Science are Machine Learning and Front-End Development. However, I love to learn about new fields within cs and improve my skills with back-end develeopment, databases, and mobile development. I've had internship experience with ML, automation, front-end development, and testing. My expected graduation is May 2022 and I hope to work as a software engineer. Some of my personal interests are working out, hiking, hanging out with my dog, and drinking iced coffee! </p>
